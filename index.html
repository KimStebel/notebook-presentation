# Notebooks

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

 * Supports over 40 programming languages
 * Code can produce rich output such as images, videos, LaTeX, and JavaScript
 * Supports Spark, from Python, R and Scala

# Notebooks - but...

 * Notebooks are single user. Each user needs their own notebook server instance, usually run locally or behind a login (e.g. bluemix spark service, coursera).
 * How do we use notebooks in documentation/tutorials/demos? Requirements: No installation, no login (still in "discover, try and buy")

---

# tmpnb - Temporary Notebook Server

 * [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb) launches a docker container for each user that requests one.
 * used to provide temporary notebooks
 * used at user groups, meetups, and workshops to provide temporary access to a full system without any installation
 * runs https://try.jupyter.org/.

# Thebe - An alternative Notebook UI

Tmpnb solves the multiuser problem, but it still has the same clunky UI.

[Thebe](https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe) is a Javascript library that uses tmpnb as a backend for code execution.

It can be integrated into any website like this:

```
$(function(){
    new Thebe({
        selector: "code.python",
        kernel_name: "python2",
        url:"http://some.tmpnb.server.com:8000"
    });
});
```

Any `<code>` tag will have a run button added.

```
<code class="python">
    import cloudant
    ...
</code>
```

# Thebe - workflow

You can create content as a notebook and publish as markdown with Thebe.

 * Create a notebook locally using the normal notebook UI
 * Save the notebook as markdown
 * Add Thebe
 * Publish as HTML

# Examples

 * [Spark](http://185.73.38.147:8080/_site/programming-guide.html)
 * [Cloudant and node.js](http://185.73.38.147:8080/thebe/test-javascript.html)
 * [Cloudant, curl, jq](http://185.73.38.147:8080/thebe/test-bash.html)
 * [Cloudant Python](http://185.73.38.147:8080/thebe/test-python.html)
