# Notebooks

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

 * Supports over 40 programming languages
 * Code can produce rich output such as images, videos, LaTeX, and JavaScript
 * Supports Spark, from Python, R and Scala

# Notebooks - but...

 * Notebooks are single user. Each user needs their own notebook server instance, usually run locally or behind a login (e.g. bluemix spark service, coursera).
 * How do we use notebooks in documentation/tutorials/demos? Requirements: No installation, no login (still in "discover, try and buy")

---

# tmpnb - Temporary Notebook Server

 * [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb) launches a docker container for each user that requests one.
 * In practice, this gets used to provide temporary notebooks, demo the IPython notebook as part of a Nature article, or even provide Jupyter kernels for publications. 
 * used it at user groups, meetups, and workshops to provide temporary access to a full system without any installation whatsoever. It also runs https://try.jupyter.org/.

# Thebe - An alternative Notebook UI

[Thebe](https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe) is a Javascript library that uses tmpnb as a backend and can be integrated into any website.

```
$(function(){
    new Thebe({
        selector:"code.python",
        kernel_name: "python2",
        url:"http://some.tmpnb.server.com:8000"
    });
});
```

```
<code class="python">
    import cloudant
    ...
</code>
```

# Thebe - from notebook to markdown to thebe page

You can create content as a notebook and publish as markdown with Thebe.

 * Create a notebook locally
 * Save as markdown
 * Add Thebe
 * Publish to HTML

# Questions?

 * Deployment?
 * ... ?
